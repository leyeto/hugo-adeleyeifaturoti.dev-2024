{{< alert "tag" >}} **Hey, welcome to my blog! I intend to share my thoughts,
stories, ideas, and experiences. These are mostly things that interest me, they
are a mix of wild, crazy, sane and common sense. A lot you might not be able to
relate with or understand. I ask you try to keep an open-mind and not take
offense if you don't get it or agree, I respect that.** {{< /alert >}}

Some stories might be personal and universal, practical and reflective. From the
mundane to the extraordinary, I hope to capture snippets of life and ideas as I
see and live it. I think I'm an adventurous person and love to explore, I'm not
good at reading books but I do listen to a lot of books, enjoy fitness, travel
and other random thoughts that I cannot seem to stop reflecting on.

Happy reading!
